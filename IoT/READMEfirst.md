# General Instructions

## Virtual Environment Creation
- Make sure that your python code file is in a folder.
- Inside that folder, open the terminal or go there via `cd` command.
- To create a virtual environment use this command 
```bash
python3 -m venv myvenv
```
- To activate your virtual environment 
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```
- To install required packages 
```bash
python3 -m pip install EnterPackageNameHere
```
- - To run the python script
```bash
python3 filename.py
```
> If `python3` doesn't work at any point, switch to `python`.
