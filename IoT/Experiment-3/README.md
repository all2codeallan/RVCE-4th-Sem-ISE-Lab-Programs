# Experiment 3: Use an Arduino Nano to interface between an LCD display and computer's USB port to show different kinds of information on your LCD screen, including system stats like network utilization, CPU load and disk space.

## Setup Instructions
- Nothing to do here.


## Circuit Setup
- Connect the `GND` pin of the LCD to the `GND` pin of the Arduino Nano/Uno (analog side).
- Connect the `VCC` pin of the LCD to the `5V` pin of the Arduino Nano/Uno (analog side).
- Connect the `SDA` pin of the LCD to the `A4` pin of the Arduino Nano/Uno.
- Connect the `SCL` pin of the LCD to the `A5` pin of the Arduino Nano/Uno.
