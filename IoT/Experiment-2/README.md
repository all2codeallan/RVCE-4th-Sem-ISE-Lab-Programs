# Experiment 2: Using a pulse oximeter and heart rate monitor with Arduino UNO, measure your heart rate and oxygen saturation level.

## Setup Instructions
- Nothing to do here.


## Circuit Setup
- Connect the `GND` pin of the heartbeat sensor to the `GND` pin of the Arduino Uno (analog side).
- Connect the `VCC` pin of the heartbeat sensor to the `5V` pin of the Arduino Uno (analog side).
- Connect the `A0/Signal` pin of the heartbeat sensor to the `A0` pin of the Arduino Uno.
